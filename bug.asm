mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `ebx + ecx * 4`.  The bug arises when `ecx` is a very large value.  If `ecx` exceeds the limits of the addressable memory space, it leads to an error. This is likely a buffer overflow or segmentation fault depending on the OS and memory protection mechanisms.  If `ebx` is also large, this can exacerbate the problem leading to even larger addresses being calculated.  The issue is that the code lacks any bounds checking to prevent `ecx` from being too large.

This specific issue can cause unpredictable behavior, including program crashes, incorrect calculations, or system instability.
